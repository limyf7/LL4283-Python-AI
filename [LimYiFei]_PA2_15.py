Based on the p values, it seems like age is the best predictor of whether the donated sperm will
be healthy. The next most relevant factor is alcohol consumption. The older the age, or the more
the person consumes alcohol, the more damage to sperms there will be. The p value is 0.083 and
0.146 respectively.

The accident variable has negative coefficients. This seems to suggest that having accidents
increases sperm health, but this is unlikely to be the case. It could be simply due to the fact
that many people experience accidents at some point in their life, and the data collection process
does not differentiate between serious or mild accidents. As most diagnosis tend to be normal, it
resulted in the negative coefficient.

The variables with that are least likely to affect the diagnosis include whether the person had
childhood diseases (p value 0.70) and whether the person had surgical intervention (p value 0.80).
This is possibly because of the wide scope of how the data was collected, it does not exclude
childhood diseases or surgical intervention that are unrelated to sperm health, nor consider the
severity. The number of irrelevant data would have caused noise in the data, and affect the p values.

In conclusion, the most important information needed would be age, and next would be alcohol
consumption.

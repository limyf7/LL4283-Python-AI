To find out whether PDPC's listed criterias for determining the amount of financial penalty truly influences the actual
fine amount, by extracting the guideline listed criterias from published cases, and comparing their statistical
relationship with the fine amount, against the statistical relationship of other unlisted variables with the fine
amount, for if the listed criterias are not statistically significant in predicting the fine amount, it undermines the
trust in the institution to communicate the factors that influence the penalty, and if the unlisted variables show
statistical significance in predicting the fine amount, it may reveal hidden biases or factors that influence the fine
amount, where knowing the variables will help increase certainty in business context if there is a breach, hence the
main objective is to find out whether there is a correlation or lack thereof between certain variables and the final
fine amount, and from there deduce whether it is a significant factor considered when determining the fine amount.

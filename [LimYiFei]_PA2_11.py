Since the data is only recorded in 0 and 1, the there should only be two possible values. Percentile is defined as "each
of the 99 intermediate values of a random variable". Naturally, calculating percentiles for a data set with only two
possible values, will yield new values in between those possible values. The assumption is that these new values will
indicate how likely the data in the specific percentile will be closer to either 0 or 1.
